    <h2>Constraints and Rules for Order:</h2>
    <p>TypeScript adds additional rules and constraints to JavaScript, particularly through static typing. These rules help detect errors early and improve the structure and maintainability of code.</p>

    <h2>Structural Type Checking:</h2>
    <p>In TypeScript, types are compared structurally, meaning that two types are considered equal if their structures are the same, regardless of their names. This facilitates working with different modules and libraries.</p>

    <h2>Void Return Type:</h2>
    <p>The return type void in TypeScript indicates that a function has no return values, and it is equivalent to undefined. This differs from some other statically typed languages where void is more specific.</p>

    <h2>Functions as Objects:</h2>
    <p>Functions are represented as objects in TypeScript, allowing functions to be passed as parameters and used as return values.</p>

    <h2>Method Overloading and Overriding:</h2>
    <p>TypeScript allows method overloading, where only one implementation can exist. Method overriding is possible without special annotations as in Java.</p>

    <h2>Optional Parameters and Non-Null Assertion:</h2>
    <p>TypeScript allows the use of optional parameters in functions (e.g., x?: number) and non-null assertion (x!.toString()) to inform the compiler that a variable will never be null or undefined.</p>
