            "Neon Genesis Evangelion" unfolds in a dystopian future where Earth is under the constant threat of mysterious beings known as
             "Angels." Humanity's last hope lies in the hands of NERV, 
            a shadowy organization that deploys colossal biomechanical robots, the Evangelions, to defend against these
             celestial invaders. Yet, this premise is just the tip of the iceberg.
